            <h2>Education:</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 6%;">Growing up, my parents believed that receiving a strong education was the best
                thing they could give me,
                therefore after pre-school I went to a christian private school called Bear Creek from K-4 and then
                moved to complete my middle and high school education at Eastside Preparatory School. I am currently in
                my senior year, and am set to graduate and attend Carnegie Mellon University for all four years of
                college in Fall 2022.</p>

        <div class="about-right">
            <h2>Web Design:</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:4%;">I have been doing Web Design since it became a passion of mine the summer before
                8th grade. I took an
                online course throughout that summer and the concept of creating my own websites grasped my interest
                quickly. From there, I signed up for a required WEB class during school, then took a Web Design 1 and
                Web Design 2 class as electives throughout high school. I thoroughly enjoy it and hope to continue into
                college and perhaps after. </p>

        <div class="about-left2">
            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:6%;">Some of my hobbies include Soccer, which I play at a club, hs, and college level.
                I invest a lot of my
                time into athletics such as this and ultimate frisbee. Additionally, I play piano (used to be
                competitively), clarinet, and saxophone. I also enjoy programming and playing videogames such as Call of
                Duty and FIFA.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-right2">
            <h2>Future Interests:</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:4%;"> In the future, I'd like to pursue a career in the tech industry. Although I
                would like to go to a
                professional level in soccer before this, within 4 years of leaving college I'd like to begin working at
                a major tech company. I am going to Carnegie Mellon enrolled in the Information Systems department. This
                will allow me to pursue a more detailed subject once I have enough information to make a full choice on
                my career. </p>
