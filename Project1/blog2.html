        Over the years, I’m sure that all of you reading this have been told to shoot for the moon, or, if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. And sure, that may be true now, but back in the early 1900s it most definitely was not. The American Dream is the idea that there is equal opportunity for everyone in America and because of this, even the most outlandish goals could be achieved (OED Online). Sadly, that idea just does not prove true. Even in the current decade, there are struggles for equality in both race and gender. Fights happen constantly over whether opportunity is the same for all peoples. Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison makes it clear that this was non-existent in the past.

The narrator in this novel has switched his ambition multiple times throughout his path thus-far. He began by spreading what were falsities in his own eyes in order to receive gratitude and work towards his dream of going to college. “I delivered an oration in which I showed that humility was the secret, indeed, the very essence of progress. (Not that I believed this – how could I, remember my grandfather? – I only believed that it worked.)” (Ellison 17) Although he does not believe in the speech that he is giving, because it works, he gives it. Therefore, he can achieve his ambitions, but at what cost. After this, he admired Dr. Bledsoe to the extent that the narrator wanted to be his assistant, but in order to do that his entire personality would have to be concealed. To achieve his goals, give and take was required throughout the book. If the main character were to keep his personality and work hard to achieve what he wanted, frankly, no progress would be made. On the contrary, a white man in this time period could work to achieve his ambitions without corrupting himself and changing his beliefs. This debunks the idea of the American dream and still is an issue to this day with equality discussions being an important part of society and an extremely necessary idea in all of our lives.
