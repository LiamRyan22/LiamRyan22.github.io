    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hello and welcome to my blog. Throughout the course of learning about 1950s literature, some aspects of the films and books that I read and watched 
        created questioning in my understanding. Therefore, I both conversed and explained topics through blog posts and one short vlog. These thoughts include some characters from hit films such as the icnoic, James Dean. You can find them all on their respective pages in the naviagtion bar.
        </h3>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Have fun reading!</h2>
