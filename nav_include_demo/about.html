    <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 18px">We are a family owned navigation business that was created in 1813. We work hard to give our customers pleasurable leisure experiences as they boat across the atlantic ocean. Additionally, we bring with us both trade items and a fully staffed and experienced crew. We have 3 boats, "Big Ducky", "Titanic", and "The Clipper", which we use to travel back and forth.</p>
